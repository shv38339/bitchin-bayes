Bayes Computational Class Project

We're Tom Jeon and Steele Valenzuela, students at UMass Amherst, enrolled in Prof. Leontine Alkema's Computational Bayesian Statistics during the spring semester of 2016.

Our class project is honed in on the following:

  - fitting Bayesian AR(1) models to observed data
  - fitting Bayesian spline models to observed data
  - fitting Bayesian AR(1) models to the residuals of the spline data in order to determine stationarity
  
We'll do our best to make this a cohesive and comprehensible GitHub repository as well as class project.
